# Welcome to FrackMan!
## Description
A game coded in C++. The player has to help navigate the Frackman around the oil field until he finds all
the oil barrels. There are various other items along the way
along with Protestors that want to force the Frackman to leave the field. Developing this game tested proper
object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, and recursion.

The game can be played by running the executable within the Debug Folder.
