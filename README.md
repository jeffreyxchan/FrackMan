# Welcome to FrackMan!
It was the middle of Winter quarter 2016 here at UCLA when
the students of CS 32 with Professors Carey Nachenberg
and David Smallberg were faced with the task of building
a video game. We were provided with a code skeleton that
contained all the graphical tools that we needed to run and
display the game. The real task was to write all the 
superclasses and subclasses that formed the interface
of the game. This project stretched our abilities with inheritance,
polymorphism, recursion, and knowledge of the C++ STL. I hope to
never go through such pain again.

## Objective
You, the player, must play as the Frackman and help him find all the oil
barrels within oil field. Dig around to find all the hidden oil barrels
that lie within the field find some extra treasures while you're at it.
But the Frackman isn't alone in this oil field. Protesters, who are opposed
to the FrackMan's schenanigans spawn onto the oil field in hopes of
chasing the Frackman off. Maneuver your way through hardcore protesters
and boulders to become a FrackMan Hero!

## Controls
<pre>
The Arrow Keys - Moves the Frackman around the oil field
Space Bar      - Shoots water from the Frackman's squirt gun
Tab            - Drops a gold nugget to bribe any chasing protesters
Z or z         - Uses a sonar charge to reveal nearby hidden objects
Esc            - Restarts the level at the cost of a life
